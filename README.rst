Python client library for OctoPrint REST API

This is continued work after the great start by Miro Hrončok of covering the
OctoPrint REST API. Nearly all current functionality in the API has been covered (up to OctoPrint 1.3.11),
but as of yet I have not had time to add extensive testing for all aspects of the API.

Installation
------------

The easiest way to install the package is via ``pip``::

    $ pip install octorest
    

Examples
--------

You may want a function which returns an instance of the OctoRest object connected to your printer.

.. code-block:: python

   def make_client(url, apikey):
        """Creates and returns an instance of the OctoRest client.
        
        Args:
            url - the url to the OctoPrint server
            apikey - the apikey from the OctoPrint server found in settings
        """
        try:
            client = OctoRest(url=url, apikey=apikey)
            return client
        except ConnectionError as ex:
            # Handle exception as you wish
            print(ex)
            
Once we have a client we can do many a cool thing with it!
For example the following retrieves all the G-code file names on your OctoPrint server and adds them to a string which is printed out.

.. code-block:: python

   def file_names(client):
        """Retrieves the G-code file names from the
        OctoPrint server and returns a string message listing the
        file names.
        
        Args:
            client - the OctoRest client
        """
        message = "The GCODE files currently on the printer are:\n\n"
        for k in client.files()['files']:
            message += k['name'] + "\n"
        print(message)

Maybe you want to stop your print and then subsequently home the printer. This is very simple to do using OctoRest!

.. code-block:: python

   def toggle_home(client):
        """Toggles the current print (if printing it pauses and
        if paused it starts printing) and then homes all of
        the printers axes.
        
        Args:
            client - the OctoRest client 
        """
        print("Pausing the print!")
        client.pause()
        print("Homing your 3d printer...")
        client.home()
